Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be considered for the Software Development Intern position.

The exercise:

main.php is the entry file.
     
The helpers are used to test the design.
        
In the implementation of PlayersObject, readPlayers only processes data without saving, normally processing data and saving data are done within one method. So I implemented Parser Utilities so that different kinds of data could be processed. With the help of IDataParser interface, new sources could be added and processed as well.
     
Same ideas were applied in View to display the players in different ways.
     
Breaking down one interface into three ensure the Single-responsibility.
